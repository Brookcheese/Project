        <h4>Who created Game Bros?</h4>
        <p>The creator of Game Bros. is a university student who started his experince with HTML. My goal is to learn to create better websites as I gain more experience. This is the first webpage I created, so it's to no suprise it looks very simple, but eventually I'll shape it into a finer website. If you wish to contact me, or simply send a message, you can do so in the contact menu. You can access it through the top or bottom navegation bar.</p>
